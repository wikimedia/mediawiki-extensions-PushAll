These is the install file for the PushAll extension.

Extension page on mediawiki.org: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PushAll
Latest version of the install file: https://github.com/BorderCloud/PushAll

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''PushAll'' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# PushAll
wfLoadExtension( 'PushAll' );

== Configuration to push the pages attached by their namespaces ==

Configuration of push is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of PushAll. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [https://github.com/BorderCloud/PushAll/blob/master/extension.json push
settings file]. You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the
ettings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

You can push in same time other pages attached by their namespaces and the same title.
Example:
<source lang="php">
$egPushAllAttachedNamespaces[] = "Data";
$egPushAllAttachedNamespaces[] = "Discussion";
</source>

=== PushAll targets ===

Any users can add push targets directly in their preferences, tab "Targeted wikis".

By default there are no targets, which will cause the push tab to not be shown anywhere until you add at least one target.

=== Tab display ===

When using vector like skins, you can choose to have the push tab displayed on the page itself, or in the action menu
you can open by clicking the down arrow next to the visible tabs. For this, an user need to set the option in the preferences
to either true or false. The default is false.

=== Authentication ===

In the preferences, you can declare a targeted wiki with a bot (a botname and a key) created in this remote wiki.

=== Pushing files ===

You can choose to push the files used in the page you are pushing or in the special page 'Push'.
